I see also that Death is basically a Scene, which confirms my choice of ”Scene” over ”Room” since you can have a death scene, but a death room is kind of odd. ”Maze” and ”Map” are basically the same so I’m going to go with ”Map” since I used it more often. I don’t want to do a battle system, so I’m going to ignore ”Alien” and ”Player” and save that for later. The ”Planet” could also just be another scene instead of something specific.
